## Addresses ##
# Specifies which address the Nomad agent should bind to for network services, including the HTTP interface as well as the internal gossip protocol and RPC mechanism. 
# This should be specified in IP format, and can be used to easily bind all network services to the same address. 
# It is also possible to bind the individual services to different addresses using the addresses configuration option. 
# Dev mode (-dev) defaults to localhost. 
# The value supports go-sockaddr/template format.
nomad_bind_address: "0.0.0.0"
# Specifies the advertise address for individual network services. 
# This can be used to advertise a different address to the peers of a server or a client node to support more complex network configurations such as NAT. 
# This configuration is optional, and defaults to the bind address of the specific network service if it is not provided.
# Any values configured in this stanza take precedence over the default bind_addr.

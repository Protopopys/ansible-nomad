# Specifies the maximum time-to-live (TTL) for cached ACL tokens.
# This does not affect servers, since they do not cache tokens.
# Setting this value lower reduces how stale a token can be, but increases the request load against servers.
# If a client cannot reach a server, for example because of an outage, the TTL will be ignored and the cached value used.
